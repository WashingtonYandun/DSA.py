# Linked list

This Ds provides a logical connection between data elements that are stored in memory in **different locations physically (not together or near)**. Data **elements are stored in nodes** along with **reference links to the next immediate data element**.

Linked list removes the hassle of pre-defining the memory blocks, provides flexibility to scale up data dynamically, simplifies the data operations, and ensures optimum usage of memory.
