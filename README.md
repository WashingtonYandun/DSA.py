## DATA STRUCTURES

### Linked List

This Data Structure (Sll) provides a logical connection between data elements that are stored in memory in **different locations physically (not together or near)**. Data **elements are stored in nodes** along with **reference links to the next immediate data element**.

Linked list removes the hassle of pre-defining the memory blocks, provides flexibility to scale up data dynamically, simplifies the data operations, and ensures optimum usage of memory.

#### My Implementations:

-   Based on Singly Linked List and SllNode class made by my own.

---

### Doubly Linked List

A Doubly Linked List (DLL) based on the Singly Linked List contains an extra pointer, typically called previous pointer (prev), together with next pointer and data which are there in **Singly Linked List**. Easier to use than Singly Linked List

#### My Implementation

-   Based on Singly Linked List and SllNode class made by my own just adding the extra pointer and changing the algorithms of it.

---

### Circular Linked List

Circular linked list is a Singly Linked List (Sll) where all nodes are connected to form a circle. **The las element points to the head** . There is no NULL at the end.

#### My Implementations:

-   Based on Singly Linked List and SllNode class made by my own. Changing the algorithms of it.

---

### Doubly Circular Linked List

Doubly Circular Linked List (Dcll) is a Doubly Linked List (Dll) where all nodes are connected to form a circle. **The last element points to the head itsand the head points to the last with its extra pointer (prev)**. There is no NULL at the end or the begining.

#### My Implementations:

-   Based on Doubly Linked List and Circular Linked List made by my own. Changing the algorithms of them.

---

### Stack

This one is a linear data structure that is based on **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)**. The **Stack** rule. In wich each new element that are going to be inserted is placed on the top of the Stack and if we want to delete a element the top element (Last in) is removed from the Stack.

#### My Implementations:

-   Based on python built in Lists
-   Based on Singly Linked List class. (Built by my own)

---

### Queues

**Queue** follows the **First In First Out (FIFO)** rule - the item that goes in first is the item that comes out first. The oposite of **Stack**

#### My Implementations:

-   Based on python built in Lists
-   Based on Singly Linked List class. (Built by my own)
