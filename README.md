# Linked list

This Data Structure provides a logical connection between data elements that are stored in memory in **different locations physically (not together or near)**. Data **elements are stored in nodes** along with **reference links to the next immediate data element**.

Linked list removes the hassle of pre-defining the memory blocks, provides flexibility to scale up data dynamically, simplifies the data operations, and ensures optimum usage of memory.

### My Implementations:

- Based on Singly Linked List and SllNode class made by my own.

# Stack

This one is a linear data structure that is based on **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)**.
The **Stack** rule. In wich each new element that are going to be inserted is placed on the top of the Stack and if we want to delete a element the top element (Last in) is removed
from the Stack.

### My Implementations:

- Based on python built in Lists
- Based on Singly Linked List class. (Built by my own)

# Queues

**Queue** follows the **First In First Out (FIFO)** rule - the item that goes in first is the item that comes out first. The oposite of **Stack**

### My Implementations:

- Based on python built in Lists
- Based on Singly Linked List class. (Built by my own)
