# DSA.py - Competitive Programming and LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various competitive programming problems and LeetCode challenges, all implemented in pure Python or SQL (Depends on the category)

## LeetCode

This section includes my solutions to LeetCode problems. For each problem, I strive to provide not only the solution but also an the result of its efficiency and complexity.

## Project Euler

In this section, you can find my solutions to the Project Euler problems. Project Euler offers a series of challenging mathematical and computational problems.
